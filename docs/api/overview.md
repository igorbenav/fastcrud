# API Reference Overview

Welcome to the API Reference section of our documentation. This section provides detailed information about the various classes, functions, and modules that make up our application. Whether you are looking to extend the application, integrate with it, or simply explore its capabilities, this section will guide you through the intricacies of our codebase.

## Key Components

Our application's API is comprised of several key components, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **FastCRUD Class**: This class is at the heart of our CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It provides a convenient and efficient way to interact with our database models.
